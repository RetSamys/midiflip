# midiflip
A python program to automatically tonal flip a midi file for Andrew Huang's #MIDIFLIP challenge. Please be advised: This was more of a feasibility programming project than anything else, only taking into account the most basic formatting of the MIDI file format. Future coders might find the comments in this simplest of programs more enlightening than the cold and technical documentation of the MIDI file format. Dunno.
